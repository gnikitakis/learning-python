# Python - The Practical Guide
Learn Python from the ground up and use Python to build a hands-on project from scratch!

Code developed following the instructions of the Udemy Course "Python - The Practical Guide" [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-by-building-a-blockchain-cryptocurrency/)

## Description
In this course, you'll learn Python from scratch - and you'll do so whilst building your own Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. These are of course also highly trending topics and not a lot of people understand what a Blockchain really is. As a nice side-effect, you will know how a Blockchain works once you completed this course. It's an exciting course project that allows you to learn and apply Python to something you know and you can use.

## Knowledge that I have gained:
- A summary of Python and the Blockchain technology
- All the base Python syntax you need to know (variables, operators, functions, ...)
- Loops and conditional statements
- More complex data structures like tuples or dictionaries
- A closer look at built-in functions and the standard library Python ships with
- String manipulation
- How to work with files
- Error handling
- Debugging
- Object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance
- Internal & external modules (packages)
- How to spin up an Http server with the Flask package
- Handling Http requests (sending & receiving)
- And more!
